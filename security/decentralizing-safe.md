<h1 style="text-align: center;">Decentralizing Safe</h1>

# Safe web app

- Dependent on the Safe transaction service (indexer)
- Alternatives
    - If the Safe web app is down
    - E.g. Apps that run their own parallel instance of the Safe transaction service
        - Coinshift: [coinshift.xyz](https://coinshift.xyz)
        - Multis: [multis.com](https://multis.com)

# Safe transaction service features

1. Off-chain signature aggregation
    a. This is difficult to built in a more decentralized approach
    b. Potential solutions
    - Use Waku for signature aggregation
    - Post the signatures to a significantly less expensive execution layer instead of mainnet
2. Transaction history
3. Show token balances automatically
    a. Cannot be handled with a simple RPC connection, it requires an index
    
# Opportunities

## Simple app for users

- A working UI where users can use basic Safe account features if the main Safe Ecosystem Foundation hosted service is unavailable
- E.g. Basic app hosted by IPFS
    - Enables onchain approvals (signatures) only
    - Or it could present approvals to the user for manual aggregation/import/export
    - Also useful for deploying infrastructure on chains that don't yet have Safe transaction service support

## More distributed backend service for builders

- Alternative backend services for developers to build on that are not reliant on the Safe Ecosystem Foundation hosted service
- E.g. Use Ceramic + ComposeDB to move towards a more distributed framework that also allows apps to perform a high amount of transactions

## Risks

- IPFS hosted solution will not be sufficient due to the backend service dependencies
- Maintaining a workable app with good UX is not trivial and requires ongoing support and resources
