# Safe web app

- Dependent on the Safe transaction service
- Alternatives
    - If the Safe web app is down
    - E.g. Apps that run their own parallel instance of the Safe transaction service
        - Coinshift: [coinshift.xyz](https://coinshift.xyz)
        - Multis: [multis.com](https://multis.com)

# Safe transaction service

Useful features

1. Off-chain signature aggregation
    a. This is difficult to built in a more decentralized approach
    b. Potential solutions
    - Use Waku for signature aggregation
    - Post the signatures to a significantly less expensive execution layer instead of mainnet
2. Transaction history
3. Show token balances automatically
    a. Cannot be handled with a simple RPC connection, it requires an index
    
# Decentralizing Safe transaction service

## Proof-of-concept (PoC)

- Minimalist UI
- An IPFS hosted version could enable onchain signatures only
- Or it could present them to the user for manual aggregation/import/export
- Also useful deploy infrastructure on chains that doesnâ€™t yet have Safe transaction service support

## Risks

- IPFS hosted solution will not be sufficient due to the backend service dependencies
- Maintaining a workable app with good UX is not trivial and requires ongoing support and resources
