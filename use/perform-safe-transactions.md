Perform transactions

## About

#### On-chain

- The last cosigner confirms the transaction (txn) that executes on-chain.
- The on-chain txn pays the network fee and is recorded in the cosigner's address history.
- If the cosigner does not have enough funds for the txn fee the txn can fail with txn fees lost.

#### Limits and queue

- There are no time limits to sign txns.
- [Transaction queue](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/4987205-transaction-queue)
    - No other txn can be executed until the current txn is executed, canceled, or replaced.
    - First in first out (FIFO)

#### Security features

- Transaction simulation
    - [How Safe Integrates TX Simulations to Bring Multisig Users Security and Peace of Mind](https://blog.tenderly.co/case-studies/safe/) *by tenderly*
- DeFirewall by Redefine
    - Identifies the risks of using the contract(s) involved in making a transaction(s)
    - Displays the proposed asset balance changes
    - E.g. Is the contract on a known block list, is there little to no contract activity, etc.
    - *See [Redefine security with new Safe{Wallet} transaction risk scanner](https://safe.mirror.xyz/rInLWZwD_sf7enjoFerj6FIzCYmVMGrrV8Nhg4THdwI) by Safe*

## Steps

1. Create the txn: Safe > Submit *New Transaction*
    a. If verifying a txn: Follow the [off and on-chain steps]() to check that the data matches.
    b. Sign the txn on the wallet.
    c. Partially signed txns show in *Transactions* > *Queue*
2. Complete the transaction with the required threshold of cosigners: Safe > *Transactions*
    a. *Confirm*
    b. *Cancel*

    c. [Speed up an approved and pending transaction.](https://hackmd.io/@safe/og/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40safe%2Fopportunities#Transaction-management-P2)
3. Check the wallet's [token approval amounts](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1uPMUppk7BZ5ZLmLx0ht0RPrneDTyiXKAfr2kV9YK_C4/edit).

## Features

#### Advanced options

- Go to Safe > *Transactions > Queue > Confirm> Advanced options > Edit*
- *Owner Transaction (Execution) > Nonce*: Use the same nonce on the signer's address as originally used if overwriting or canceling a pending transaction.
- *Gas limit*: Auto-generated, do not adjust.
- *Gas price (GWEI)*: Auto-generated, can use [Ethereum Gas Tracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker#historicaldata) to verify.

#### Bundle multiple transactions

- *See [Transaction Builder](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40841-transaction-builder)*
- Approve multiple transactions with one set of signatures.
- Convert to [Uint256 format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pfGXa-DCOBQ6Ed7w1Q_XNaTtiUwuWRQSLgJ6vZ4v85I/edit#heading=h.ohamhurjxbk)

#### Sell multiple assets

- [dump.services](https://dump.services)
    - Built by CoW Swap and Yearn.
    - Features
        - Sell multiple assets in an account at a selected quantity
        - Choose which account to receive the sale proceeds
    - *See [@CoWSwap Tweet 2023-05-03](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1653761691442872330)*
- Research: Is it possible to execute CoW Swap trades with the Safe Transaction Builder using [CoW Swap's settlement](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9008D19f58AAbD9eD0D60971565AA8510560ab41#events) contract?
    - The settlement contract has a `swap` method
        - This could be hard to do with the Transaction Builder since you'd likely need to input a static gas price and token prices, rather than taking the real time gas price and token market prices.

## Troubleshoot

- If using a Ledger: [Enable smart contract data](https://hackmd.io/fNvoR6H4RjCygPVIn7-Fzw#2-Add-ETH-addresses-as-signers)
- Ensure the cosigner has enough funds to execute the on-chain txn.
- Txn not showing in Safe
    - Check Etherscan in a few minutes.
    - If showing in Etherscan and not in Safe
        - Restart Safe and cosigner wallet.
        - Check the Safe UI in a few minutes.
